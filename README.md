## Welcome Aboard! 

The subject of this academic work is to code a solution for various scientific problems such as convolution matrix, fractals, complex numbers or pixels management. 
Here is a  to get to the documentation of the code.

## The documentation

As our code may not be as explicit for us as for you, we used the docfx software and the "/// comments" to create a documentation page hosted on this [link](https://morgankryze.github.io/Computer_Science_Problem/ "Complete documetation").

## Structure

### Core classe

* A GameManager - contains the calls for the processing functions such as main menu, actions, file choice and so on.

### Visual classe

* A ConsoleVisuals class - contains the methods to display the menu and the results.

### Processing classes

* A Convolution class - contains the properties and the kernels to apply to an image.
* An Image class - contains the attributes and methods to process a bmp file and create a virtual image out of it.
* A ConvertTo class - contains the methods to convert Little Endian byte arrays into integers and vice versa.
* A Complex class - contains the attributes and methods to process complex numbers.
* A Pixel class - contains the attributes and methods to create and manipulate pixels.
